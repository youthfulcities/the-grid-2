            Youthful Cities will not sell or rent your personal information to
            third parties, and will obtain your consent to collect, use or
            disclose personal information except where we are authorized or
            required by law to do so without consent. For example, we may
            collect, use or disclose personal information without your knowledge
            or consent where:
          </Text>
          <ol>

              the information is publicly available, as defined by statute or

            <li>we are obtaining legal advice; or</li>
            <li>
              we reasonably expect that obtaining consent would compromise an
              investigation or proceeding.

            <li>Other exceptions may apply.</li>
          </ol>

            Your consent can be express, implied or given through an authorized
            representative such as a lawyer, agent or broker.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Consent may be provided orally, in writing, electronically, through
            inaction (such as when you fail to notify us that you do not wish
            your personal information collected/used/disclosed for various
            purposes after you have received notice of those purposes) or
            otherwise.

          <Text>
            You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal, contractual
            and other restrictions, provided that you give reasonable notice of
            withdrawal of consent to us. On receipt of notice of withdrawal of
            consent, we will inform you of the likely consequences of the
            withdrawal of consent, which may include our inability to provide
            certain services for which that information is necessary.

            website, social media sites or other online sites, or mobile
            applications will be considered non-confidential and

            personal information to any of our offices or affiliates throughout
            the world in connection with any products or services you request,
            or in connection with any communications you wish to have with us,

          3. Types of Data Collected
        </Heading>
        <View className='inner-container'>
          <Text>The types of personal data we may collect include:</Text>
          <Text>
            3.1 Personal Information: Personal information is any information
            about an identifiable person. This includes information such as your
            name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other
            identifiers that can be used to identify you. This policy applies to
            personal information about individuals and does not apply to the
            information collected, used or disclosed with respect to corporate
            or commercial entities. Also, this policy does not impose any limits
            on our collection, use or disclosure of information exempted under
            applicable privacy legislation, including business contact
            information and certain publicly available information.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            3.2 Demographic Information: Including but not limited to age,
            gender, income level, education level, employment status.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            3.3 Research Data: Responses to Survey Questions and Interview
            Questions, including opinions, experiences, and other information
            provided directly by the participant.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            3.4 Indicator Data: Publically available data and/or information
            obtained from local experts.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            3.5 Aggregate information: Standard web server/visitor traffic
            information, commonly referred to as ‘aggregate information’,
            regarding overall website traffic patterns. Web servers normally
            collect this type of basic information as part of their web log
            processes. This aggregate information does not identify you and thus
            does not constitute personal information.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            In addition to information provided by our visitors we use the
            normal Internet tracking tools associated with standard Internet
            protocols and web–based systems. This system information is
            typically stored in log files and the information is used for
            aggregate reporting. Aggregate reporting includes total number of
            visitors, most visited sections, peak traffic times, etc. Log files
            are simply transaction records web servers maintain. Those logs are
            used for recording information, such as:
          </Text>
          <ul>
            <li>service provider IP addresses;</li>
            <li>browser versions;</li>
            <li>referring websites;</li>
            <li>search terms used;</li>
            <li>average number of pages requested;</li>
            <li>average duration of visit;</li>
            <li>total visitor traffic.</li>
          </ul>
          <Text>
            We use aggregate information gathered from your visit to better
            design our website. This information supplies us with a broad
            picture of how people use our website in order to help the
            management of our systems and to better serve our audience.

            Youthful Cities will not collect information indiscriminately and

          5. Cookies
        </Heading>
        <View className='inner-container'>
          <Text>
            A cookie is a small text file sent from a Web server and placed on
            your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is generally used to enhance
            your browsing experience. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may
            not be able to access some of the interactive features on our Web
            sites.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Cookies used by Youthful Cities do not give us access to anything on
            your hard drive and cannot do anything to your computer. Youthful
            Cities uses two types of cookies: session cookies (temporary) or
            persistent cookies (longer–term continuing use).
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Session cookies may be used to support on-line feedback/discussion,
            forms and registration and ‘e-commerce/shopping cart’ transactions.
            They are used only during your online session and expire when you
            close your browser. Without session cookies, moving around the Site
            could be much slower. Persistent cookies are different from session
            cookies because they are stored on your computer’s hard drive for
            some length of time. They are usually used if you want us to
            remember information about your Web preferences and passwords for
            automatic log-in purposes.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            In addition to the cookie uses described above, Youthful Cities may
            also use cookies to serve our remarketing campaigns so that
            third-party vendors, including Google and Facebook, show our ads on
            sites across the Internet. Youthful Cities may also use targeted
            advertising services to tailor Youthful Cities advertisements (both
            on the Site and on other sites) to your interests. You can opt out
            of these remarketing campaigns by turning off cookies in your
            browser, as described above.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Youthful Cities may also disclose some of your personal information
            (such as your gender, age, location and interests) to the providers
            of targeted advertising services to help adjust the advertisements
            to your preferences; however, in that case, Youthful Cities will
            contractually obligate the service providers to maintain the
            security of your information and only use it for the purpose of
            targeting Youthful Cities’s ads to you. You can opt out of
            participating in these targeted ad programs by contacting our
            Privacy Officer.

            How to manage your cookies: Cookies are widely used and most web
            browsers are configured initially to accept cookies automatically.
            You can choose to set your browser to detect and reject cookies, to
            accept cookies from all sites, or to prompt you whenever a site
            wants to send you a cookie. Check your browser’s “Help” files to

            could harm our competitive position. We may also be prevented by law
            from providing access to certain personal information.
