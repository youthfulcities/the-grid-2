  "story_content": "<p>In 2020, Pivot Hub was born out of Pivot 2020, a program to support young people in driving post-pandemic recovery, funded by the Government of Canada and in partnership with Simon Fraser University.</p><p>Pivot Hub, later renamed THE GRID, integrated surveys and interviews of young people across Canada with publicly available third-party information. Together, the data provided a holistic understanding of youth and their cities before and after COVID-19.</p><p>In 2023, funded by the Government of Canada, Youthful Cities analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on youth entering the workforce through DEVlab. DEVlab’s findings are integrated into the Youth Data Lab.</p><p>With Youth Data Lab, the platform transitions from a data repository to focussing on the actionable insights drawn from the data.</p>",
