  "description_p_1": "The State of Housing for Young People in Canada  investigated the national housing crisisâ€”both about the availability and affordability of homes. The primary objective of this bilingual survey was to collect insights from youth across Canada, to support the development of evidence-based solutions focussed on the housing needs of young people. A secondary objective was to evaluate co-living as a solution to affordable housing supply challenges in Canadian urban centres. Our partner, Tamarack Institute, reviewed the survey design to ensure it was inclusive and suitable for the diverse identities and lived experiences of youth. Youth Cite organizes quotes from surveyed youth into an interactive network of themes. Larger bubbles highlight the most common topics, while smaller ones reflect unique or less frequent insights.

  "method_sub_1": "Sampling Design",
  "method_p_1": "The survey targeted a representative sample of young people aged 18 to 33, reaching respondents across Canada focusing on the 15 largest urban centres. The sampling frame was designed based on Statistics Canada Census 2021 data. Respondents were identified using voluntary sampling through promotion on the Youthful Cities and Tamarack Institute media channels. Furthermore, the survey design prioritized increasing the representation of equity-deserving groups within the sample.",
  "method_sub_2": "Data collection",
  "method_p_2": "The survey was in the field between April 2024 and July 2024, exclusively through online collection. It was hosted on SurveyMonkey, a common survey data collection platform. SurveyMonkey has implemented governance, risk management, and compliance practices that align with the most globally recognized information security frameworks. SurveyMonkey has achieved ISO 27001 certification. The data collected through SurveyMonkey is encrypted and accessible to only the Youthful Cities enterprise account holder. While the survey was in the field, Youthful Cities purchased a panel sample, totalling 1500 respondents (pre-exclusion and data cleaning), from CICIC research, a Canadian, Dynata-affiliated and ESOMAR-recognized market research organization.",

  "method_p_3": "<p>While steps were taken to ensure the sample was representative of the youth population in Canada, and ethical considerations were met, some biases may be present within the data.</p><ul><li><p>Sampling bias: Although the sample was designed to be representative, certain identities may have been underrepresented or overrepresented, which can impact insights and findings.</p></li><li><p>Response bias: The survey relied on self-reported data, which may be subject to social desirability bias or recall bias, particularly for questions related to sensitive topics.</p></li></ul>"
