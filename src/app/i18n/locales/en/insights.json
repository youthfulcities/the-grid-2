  "disclaimer": "The Youthful Cities chatbot utilizes the GPT-4 language model. All training data for the model is curated by Youthful Cities. As with any AI, GPT-4 lacks real-time understanding of context and may occasionally produce irrelevant or nonsensical responses. Its responses should be evaluated critically, especially in sensitive or complex situations where human judgment is crucial.",
