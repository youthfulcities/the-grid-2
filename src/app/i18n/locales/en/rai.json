  "disclaimer_gender": "<p>*Our income data comes from Statistics Canada, which states the following regarding gender: 'Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. Individuals in the category ‚Äúnon-binary persons‚Äù are distributed into the other two gender categories.'</p><p>According to the <a>National Bureau of Economic Research</a>, 'nonbinary individuals assigned male at birth, transgender men, transgender women, and cisgender women all earn significantly less than comparable cisgender men.' As such, we have used the income of 'Women+' as a baseline for non-binary individuals. However, this may not fully reflect individual realities.</p><p>The NBER study found that 'nonbinary people assigned female at birth‚Äìdespite being more highly educated than other groups‚Äìearn significantly less than cisgender men, cisgender women, and all other gender minority groups. These gaps are larger at the bottom of the annual earnings distribution than at the top. [...] Lower-income transgender and nonbinary people may face something like a ‚Äústicky floor‚Äù (see Christofides et al. (2013)). Sticky floors represent a magnification of disadvantage for the most marginalized members of already disadvantaged groups. They may also be due to heterogeneity in the degree to which gender minority people are actually seen as cisgender people by the society surrounding them. If some members of gender minority groups are not perceived by others as gender minorities, we may expect those people to face smaller disparities.'</p>",
