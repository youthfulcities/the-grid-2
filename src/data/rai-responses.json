I had to apply to over 300 jobs this summer to pay rent because there is nothing in Halifax below 1500 that suited my needs in February when I was facing eviction because of a 200 dollar rent increase. Which was perfectly legal despite the rent cap, because my landlords tried to resend the offer of a rental renewal after I reminded them of the cap. And to be honest the rent has gone up so much since then. \n\nEvery one of my friends that stayed in university with me over the years have condo’s in Halifax that their parents bought for them. My parents can’t and won’t do that for me. Something has to budge. Because this economic climate without any change isn’t livable. This isn’t just about the future of Canadian youth - this is also MY present. \n\nI can’t even begin to imagine how bad this will be in the future if I’m not even sure I am even going to make it there.",

However i thought moving to edmonton would solve our financial problems but i was wrong ! rent in edmonton has also increased and to get a two bedroom apartment it would cost us $1300 plus home insurance and hydro and since there isn’t reliable transportation we would have to buy another car and that added cost with the highest inflation makes it impossible for us to even LIVE. we had no choice but to move our belongings into a storage but fortunately we had a friend who was so kind enough to let us live at her house for free until we are able to figure out our issue. Typically we are considered HOMELESS although we have full time jobs and this loaded pressure is not only taking a toll on me and my partner but also on our children.",

When I’m comes to the global economy we are shooting our selves in the foot by not investing in O&G. Our liberal government fails to recognize the ripple effect the O&G industry has on our nations economy. The more O&G we can provide the world in the most efficient matter means we can invest more into alternatives, infrastructure, schools and technology. This would create more jobs for young Canadians in every sector.",

    "message": "Even living in one of the more “affordable” provinces, earning a decent paycheque and working 60+ hours a week, I still live paycheque to paycheque. I’m not poor but I am struggling. I’ve never reached zero in my bank account, but I get closer every month. I don’t go out, party, smoke, do drugs or drink, yet the stress makes me want to. I fear going to therapy, the dentist, or eye doctor not because of my health but because of the price. I go to work, I come home and I sleep because the fatigue and fear of money makes me not want to risk even ordering food. My coworker said it best when he told me once, “I’m working and earning the most I ever have in my life yet I’m the brokest I’ve ever been.” It’s scary to think about, it’s alarming that most people my age or lower aren’t even thinking about the aspect of buying a house or condo anymore or the fact that some things like 1200$-1500$ rent or gas at 228 is normal now and we don’t fight or question it. The problem is we can’t keep up and we’re juggling these known federal problems with our provincial problems and personal problems as well. In my province, gender is an issue, but so is language or where in the province you come from. In my group of friends, whether you are single or not, live at home with parents or even just are luckier in life make a radical change in emotional and financial stability. These are also issues that need to be taken into consideration but can’t be because they fluctuate so radically from person to person. I’ve lost hope personally for these things to change, I hope many others haven’t lost hope, especially ones younger than me, but I can’t gain mine back. I can only hope to live a happy life, not an affordable one.",

    "message": "I grew up in a small suburb in the Vancouver metro, in a home that my parents had bought for 300k in 2002. Today, that same home is worth 2.5 million, as is everything else even remotely close to where I grew up, where my friends and family lived, and where my support network was. After university, I moved 400km east, trying to get somewhere a little more affordable. Since moving, prices have risen by 60% in my new region, pushing average prices over a million. Housing costs make up half my income now, despite living hundreds of kilometers from the nearest major city. In BC, affordability is dead, and its quickly dying in some of the few places that have been affordable (east coast, Alberta, etc). \n\nMy question for our government is this -  Where are we supposed go? \n\nI work full time and have post graduate qualifications, but my wage is nowhere near enough to get ahead in this country. Canada has more land than any country but Russia, and we can’t figure out how to reduce property prices. The only explanation I can see is that our government is not interested in making a change, it sees my spending half my income on housing as perfectly acceptable, the price of being born in the wrong era. And what do I get for living in one of the most expensive places in the developed world? Mediocre wages and mediocre services, I still can’t get a family doctor, car insurance is 3X what friends in Washington state pay just across the border, public transit is a joke, and I’ve replaced meat with rice in my diet because I can’t afford it anymore. \n\nMy next move will be abroad, and I blame the Government of Canada for forcing me, and many others in similar positions to make the same decision.",

    "message": "This level of unaffordability is unacceptable. Housing should not be an investment tool because it is necessary for people to live. Young Canadians are not even necessarily expecting to be able to buy a home, but rents should be much more affordable and it should not be possible to renovict renters in order to raise rents to excessive \"market\" levels or to call new developments affordable at rents of $3000/month, leaving renters scrambling to find and compete for affordable properties near their jobs. It feels impossible to afford the type of living space that meets a family’s needs (3 bedrooms) in major cities and this is causing hardship and a great deal of stress as young people attempt to find jobs and homes to support their families.",
