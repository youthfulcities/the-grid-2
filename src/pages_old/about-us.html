      <p>
        THE GRID is a free, open-source, intuitive portal with accessible and
        reliable data that can be used by young people, communities, planners,
        organizations, governments, and more.

        THE GRID is powered by

      How Did THE GRID<span class="alt-highlight"> Begin? </span>
    </h2>
    <div class="inner-container">
      <p>
        THE GRID, formerly known as Pivot Hub, started with the Pivot 2020
        project. COVID-19 brought lives to a halt and dramatically shifted
        everything. Our society was seeing the highest rates of youth
        unemployment in Canadian history. Young people were bearing the brunt of
        this crisis with the closing of schools and precarious work
        environments, as well as massive interruptions to social connection and
        support services. Cities can feel like closed, isolated, dire and
        un-youthful places. Pivot 2020 was created to support young people in
        driving the post-pandemic recovery. We know the power of young people to
        generate momentous change, and we need that energy and capacity for
        innovation to pivot from isolation, fear and despair to hope,
        opportunity, renewal and connection.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pivot 2020 began with 1,100+ young people in various Canadian cities by
        surveying and interviewing young people, and collecting benchmark
        information on the issues that matter to them most.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Information was gathered over 7 weeks in fall 2020 and covered three
        main components: an index, a youth survey and youth interviews. The
        scope of the project covers 47 Canadian cities, including all the
        smaller communities that make up Vancouver and Victoria. The index
        consists of publicly available third-party information that measures and
        compares how well cities across Canada are supporting young people to
        live, work, play and thrive. The survey covered 23 topics to help
        understand interactions with youth and their cities before and after
        COVID-19. Finally, the interviews were formal conversations with youth
        in Canada to identify gaps, challenges and opportunities related to the
        city’s COVID-19 crisis response and recovery, based on individual
        viewpoints and experiences. After the research was compiled, over 20
        data analysts prepared the data for the hub and developed insight
        reports to explore the challenges that young people are currently
        facing.

        Since its inception with Pivot 2020, Youthful Cities has continued to
        expand THE GRID and partner with more organizations using the lessons
        learned from that project.

    </h2>
    <div class="inner-container">
      <p>
        Following Pivot 2020 research, internal engagement activities took place
        with a group of 15 young people who were involved with the project.
        Through a series of workshops, they set out to create design principles
        that were drafted and later finalized to help guide the design of THE
        GRID.
