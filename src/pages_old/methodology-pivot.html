      <p>
        The Pivot 2020 Index measures cities’ youthfulness by looking at the way
        people live, work, play and thrive in their city. This allows the
        project to identify the city's strengths and areas of improvement for
        building better cities. Since 2013, Youthful Cities has created 6 unique
        indexes involving more than 75 cities from across the globe covering
        topics and creating indicators that are important to youth. Including an
        index as one of the three research tools complemented Pivot 2020’s
        project goals, so Youthful Cities offered to use its index as a base
        from which to build.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Building the Pivot Index</h3>
      <p>
        Pivot 2020 wanted to update the Youthful Cities Index indicators to
        ensure that they best captured the lived experiences of youth in cities
        across Canada in accessible, inclusive, equitable, and diverse ways. As
        Pivot 2020 continues to strive for inclusion and validating the
        expertise of youth, the project invited youth representatives from
        youth-led and youth-serving organizations across the country to join an
        advisory committee and network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Index EDI review process magnified the voices of Queer, Trans,
        Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour from regions across the country.
        The representatives from the youth-led and youth-serving organizations,
        convened for 8 weeks virtually, to discuss and workshop indicators for
        an index that better captures the diverse experiences and realities of
        youth across the country. The Youthful Cities Index measures what it’s
        like for youth to live, work, play and thrive in their city. While the
        youth-led EDI process was happening, there was a concurrent internal
        review by Pivot 2020’s Equity Lead and Partnerships Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outcome of the Index EDI review process informed the adaptation for
        the Youthful Cities Index for Pivot 2020. For Pivot 2020, the index grew
        from 21 topics to 23 (some became amalgamated and others completely
        replaced) and now consists of over 400 indicators.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Youth-led & Youth Serving Organizations</h3>
      <p>
        Youthful Cities asked that organizations prioritize those who may not
        have had experiences or opportunities like this in the past, those who
        have lived in different Canadian municipalities, and those with
        marginalized identities. Organizations were compensated $1,200 for their
        time and labour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizations were chosen based on their geographical location, and
        expertise in each of the topical areas that the topics cover. This
        ensured that all 47 cities were covered, including Vancouver’s and
        Victoria’s neighboring cities. Priority was given to organizations that
        were both youth-led and youth serving, as well as those that served
        QTBIPOC communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        A list of some, but not all, of the organizations that participated in
        this process include:
      </p>
      <ul class="youth-list">
        <li>BYTE</li>
        <li>Full Femme</li>
        <li>out saskatoon</li>
        <li>Success Beyond Limits</li>
        <li>Toronto youth food policy council</li>
        <li>Helping hands</li>
        <li>Students for Consent Culture</li>
        <li>La Connexionale</li>
        <li>Hamilton Center for Civic Inclusion</li>
        <li>Sisterhood Media</li>
        <li>Sustainabilitieens</li>
        <li>AMES</li>
        <li>
          The One North End Community Economic Development Society (The O.N.E.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3>The Pivot 2020 Index Data Collection & Verification Process</h3>
      <p>
        In fall 2020, 1,100+ Pivot 2020 team members started collecting
        indicators for the Pivot 2020 Index. The team had 2 weeks to gather this
        secondary data. To do so, indicators were assigned to each team. Some
        teams collected data on a city they were not as familiar with because
        each of our 47 cities varied in size. The data collection process
        continued with our 20+ data analysts to ensure the completion of the
        index.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>About Vancouver & Victoria</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to represent the local reality and experiences of youth
        in their cities. Pivot 2020 also acknowledges that Provincial
        governments set municipal boundaries. Most provinces have amalgamated
        cities over the past two decades. BC did not. For THE GRID, Vancouver
        and Victoria were treated uniquely. Data was collected in all the
        municipalities that make up the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) for each
        city. That data is represented separately in THE GRID. To allow for
        better comparisons, the project also chose to merge the data from each
        CMA to form a data point for Metro Vancouver and Metro Victoria. The
        following rules were used to merge data. These are noted in THE GRID.
      </p>
      <p>Merge rule options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sum of all municipal totals</li>
        <li>Average of Yes/No</li>
        <li>Average</li>
        <li>Weighted average</li>
        <li>Minimum value across all municipalities</li>
        <li>Maximum value across all municipalities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is why the Pivot 2020 Index represents 47 cities.</p>
      <p>
        All indicators went through a data verification process that was
        collected to ensure accuracy and quality. All indicators were submitted
        along with a reliable source. Pivot 2020 team members, data analysts,
        and a dedicated data review team reviewed each data point against the
        sources and corrected data accordingly, this could have included
        replacing a data source completely to ensure quality and accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once data is checked it needs to be normalized to accurately compare
        each city:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where necessary, data is converted to metric units</li>
        <li>
          All cost-based data is normalized to US dollars, measured against the
          average value of the local currency, January 1st to December 31, 2020
        </li>
        <li>
          Since Pivot 2020 was motivated by a desire to measure cities from the
          perspective of youth, and since reliable average youth income data
          does not exist in the majority of the cities in our Index, the project
          measured all cost indicators relative to one hour of minimum wage
          labour in US dollars each city. For example: If the minimum wage in a
          city is $10 and the cost of a movie ticket is $12, the cost of a movie
          ticket, tied to minimum wage equals 1.2
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While reliable, robust, and defensible data is available for the
        overwhelming majority of Pivot indicators across all cities, in a
        minority of cases (&lt5%) reliable data simply does not exist. Where
        data does not exist, it has been left blank if “zero” does not apply.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Index Data on THE GRID</h3>
      <p>
        As an outcome THE GRID holds over 23,000+ data points across 47+ cities
        for users to explore in 20 topical areas.

      Pivot 2020 <span class="alt-highlight">Survey</span> Development Process
    </h2>
    <div class="inner-container">
      <p>
        The Pivot 2020 survey is an anonymous, voluntary research tool that was
        designed to better understand how young people (15-29 years-old)
        interact with their cities, what city topics help young people live,
        work, play and thrive, and where specific cities are strong or weak with
        regards to these topics. The purpose of using this quantitative data is
        to inform cities on how best respond to - and recover from - the
        COVID-19 pandemic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Survey Design</h3>
      <p>
        The origin of the Pivot 2020 survey is from a global initiative built by
        Youthful Cities to include youth voices in civic spaces -- it was
        created by young people across 40 cities around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Pivot 2020 began, the project’s Research Director and Equity Lead
        were responsible for adapting the 2016 Youthful Cities survey to reflect
        the project's needs and goals. They also incorporated feedback from the
        project’s Executive Director as well as a group of young women of colour
        representing various community based organizations and post-secondary
        institutions in the Vancouver area.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Research Ethics Process</h3>
      <p>
        As a commitment to research ethics, Pivot 2020 underwent an extensive
        review process by Simon Fraser University’s Research Ethics Board (REB),
        an independent committee established by the university Senate. As a
        post-secondary institution that receives funding from Canada’s three
        federal research agencies <sup>1</sup>, they are required to follow the
        agencies’
        <a
          href="https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2018.html"
          >Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving
          Humans (TCPS 2)</a
        >. As part of this, all post-secondary institutions are required to set
        up an internal review process to make sure that the human research they
        conduct aligns with the TCPS 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        This review process included the submission of a Study Detail document
        that outlined the research questions, tools, collection and other
        relevant information. A
        <a
          href="https://www.sfu.ca/research/sites/default/files/2019-09/2017%2004%2019%20Study%20Detail%20Guidelines%20FINAL.pdf"
          >template</a
        >
        for the Study Detail document can be found on the University’s Office of
        Research Ethics website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional documents were submitted individually to support the Study
        Detail. These documents included (but are not limited to) informed
        consent forms, all research questions and the technology used to support
        the data collection. When changes were made to the research an amendment
        was submitted for approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        In November 2020, Simon Fraser University’s REB approved the final
        version of the survey (V5.0) for distribution. The final survey
        questionnaire is available

      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Survey Iterations & Revisions</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure relevancy of questions and topical areas in the survey, the
        Pivot 2020 survey went through various iterations and revisions. This
        process involved including various youth employed by the project
        throughout the fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall feedback was that the survey needed to be more inclusive and
        accessible, especially with respect to capturing the specific lived
        experiences of Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour. Concerns
        regarding the research ethics aspect of the survey, particularly
        regarding the lack of compensation for respondents were raised.
      </p>
      <p>
        In October 2020, youth that were employed by the project were given an
        opportunity to review and revise the survey in more depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the suggested changes the Equity Lead, along with a research
        advisor with experience in community-based research with Indigenous
        populations, made revisions accordingly. This revised survey was shared
        back with “testing triads” of youth from across Pivot 2020’s geographic
        regions and the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) team of
        approximately 17 young people employed by the project, for further
        feedback and suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project’s Equity Lead revised the survey questions according to the
        feedback from the triads. This version was presented at a meeting of the
        EDI team for final review. It should be noted that there was not a full
        consensus within the EDI team about the relevance and accessibility of
        the survey to youth from marginalized and disenfranchised communities.
        However, they accepted a compromise that would allow for a more in-depth
        exploration of youth experiences during the interview stage of Pivot
        2020.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Equity Lead incorporated the remaining edits and suggestions from
        the EDI team into the final survey (Version 5.0). Some of the final
        changes, included:
      </p>
      <ul class="rev-list">
        <li>
          Revised demographic characteristics to better capture the lived
          experiences of potential participants (e.g. expanded
          self-identification with regards to gender)
        </li>
        <li>
          Added questions to capture opinions from marginalized youth about
          their experiences (e.g. racism, transphobia, ableism, conflict with
          police, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Added questions that take a deeper dive on some of the city topics
          that have become more relevant since COVID-19
        </li>
        <li>
          Added an open ended question to the survey to provide the opportunity
          to answer “why” and share additional context to given responses
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since this version included some questions that may have elevated the
        risk to participants (e.g. there were questions about police
        interactions and racism, etc.), a research ethics amendment was
        submitted to Simon Fraser University’s REB. Valid questions were raised
        around compensation for taking the survey, specifically around arranging
        individual remuneration, which Pivot 2020 reviewed against research
        ethics and through consultation with experts at Simon Fraser University.
        In the winter, the project decided not to move forward with individual
        remuneration as a strategy for compensation in order to uphold the
        fundamental research requirement of voluntary participation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Survey Distribution</h3>
      <p>
        Pivot 2020 used a strategy called snowball sampling. Project team
        members were offered the opportunity to complete the survey and
        distribute it to friends and organizational contacts if they chose. This
        was voluntary. The project’s communications team also used social media
        promotions to target harder to reach populations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Data Clearing, Weighting & Tabulations</h3>
      <p>
        All survey data was exported out of SurveyMonkey and reviewed in SPSS.
        The first step was removing individual survey responses deemed invalid
        from the dataset:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Reason</th>
          <th>Total Removed</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Speeding: completing the survey faster than 30% of the median survey
            time
          </td>
          <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Gibberish open ended comments</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Outside of target age range</td>
          <td>152</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br />
      <p>
        The research team then considered if partial surveys should be included;
        that is, the responses from individuals who started, but did not
        complete the survey. A review of the partially completed surveys
        revealed a higher drop-off rate among respondents completing the survey
        in French, likely stemming from several programming differences when
        compared to the English version of the survey:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The questions are arranged over 8 pages for the English survey vs.
          over 45 pages for the French survey
        </li>
        <li>
          The French version was often missing the “I choose not to answer”
          response option on demographic questions (e.g.:§ respondents
          completing the survey in French who did not wish to share information
          about themselves would be required to drop out of the survey, whereas
          their English counterparts would have been able to select “I prefer
          not to answer” and then continue)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No other systemic differences between those who completed the survey and
        those who dropped out part way were detected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The research team therefore decided to include partially completed
        surveys if the respondent completed the upfront demographic section, up
        to and including question 16, and answered at least one attitudinal
        question. The requirement was set at question 19a or 19b, as questions
        17-19 were optional and 19a/b had the largest number of responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the final dataset had been identified, the sample was reviewed to
        assess its reflectiveness of urban youth in Canada to determine if any
        weighting was required. Critical to decision making was knowing that the
        goal of Pivot 2020 was to hear from youth whose voices aren’t typically
        included in research, or who are often under-represented when they are
        included. In other words, the goal was not to have a perfectly
        representative sample.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the sample was corrected by typical variables such as age or gender,
        Pivot 2020 would be diminishing or silencing the voices of exactly who
        the project wanted to hear from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaning into diversity, the project decided to only weigh the data
        geographically when looking at the total survey sample to make sure the
        cities have the correct bearing on the total. This ensures the data is
        representative on the national level, and is important for ensuring THE
        GRID is useful. Please refer to the table below for more details
        regarding regional weighting.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Survey on THE GRID</h3>
      <p>
        The Pivot 2020 survey contained approximately 180 questions, and data is
        available for all questions on THE GRID. The sample size adjusted for
        quality assurance is 3,045.
      </p>
      <p>
        Weighting of the data was conducted based on city population only.
        Weighed data is available to tabulate within THE GRID or download as raw
        data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Appendix</h3>

      <p>
        The Pivot 2020 interviews are meant to center youth stories in their own
        voice. While quantitative data shares a glimpse of what is happening, it
        is through qualitative data that one can feel why it matters. The
        interviews were meant to complement the survey and index data by going
        in-depth on the issues that matter to youth and uncover the ‘why’ behind
        the quantitative data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Interview Design</h3>
      <p>
        The research team designed and refined the interview prompts with the
        objective of using the interview as an in-depth exploration of the
        survey results. Specifically, the interview was designed as a
        semi-structured discussion to help the project understand how youth’s
        interactions with their city changed since the beginning of the
        pandemic, why certain issues or topics are the way they are and what
        cities could become. The interviews aim to identify gaps, challenges and
        opportunities related to the city’s COVID-19 crisis response and
        recovery.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Ethics, Confidentiality & Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Participation in the Pivot 2020 interviews was entirely voluntary and no
        compensation was offered to the interviewees. Both the interviewee and
        the interviewer had the option of terminating the interview at any time.
        All interviews were confidential, meaning that no name can be linked to
        the extracted quotes. Moreover, each interviewee had the option of
        choosing whether they wanted to be recorded. In either case, all
        interviewees had to give their informed consent to the interview. Once
        the interview was completed, the interviewees received a copy of the
        recording or written notes for their review and were given two days to
        request any changes or their removal from the project. For more
        information, please read through the Pivot Interview Consent Form
        <a
          href="https://youthfulcities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PIVOT-2020-Updated-Team-Member-Interview-Internal-Consent-Nov.-16.docx.pdf"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interview process was approved by the SFU Research Ethics Board
        (REB) in September 2020. It was amended in November 2020 to reflect a
        change in the technology used to conduct the interviews remotely.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an effort to uphold the highest standards of privacy and security,
        Pivot 2020 decided to conduct the interviews via a custom
        video-conferencing technology, built on the SimpleWebRTC framework by a
        company called Talky, Inc. This allowed the project to conduct the
        interviews remotely, without data passing through any server -- making
        it highly secure and private. Upon completion of the interview, the
        recording was stored directly on a server located in Canada via an
        encrypted connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        To provide another layer of privacy and confidentiality, Pivot 2020 is
        only sharing excerpts from recorded interviews on THE GRID.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Interview Collection</h3>
      <p>
        In the fall of 2020, a cohort of Pivot 2020 team members were asked to
        conduct 1-3 interviews each. Given the time constraints and the desire
        expressed by the project’s members to center young people's voices in
        the process, the scope of the Pivot 2020 interviews was dedicated to
        hearing from youth (aged 18-29) about their city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interview could be performed with: 1) a Pivot 2020 peer (a team
        leader or team member from the Pivot 2020 network who lives in the same
        city as the interviewer); and/or 2) a youth outside the Pivot 2020
        network (a young person whom they knew outside the Pivot 2020 network,
        who also lived in the same city).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, 500+ interviews were conducted, each lasting approximately
        30 minutes. From these, the Pivot 2020 fall cohort was tasked to perform
        thematic analysis that addressed: 1) how have people’s interactions with
        their city changed because of COVID-19?; 2) how do people imagine the
        future of their city and their place within it?; 3) what opportunities
        and barriers exist to help or hinder making that future a reality? The
        project hopes to curate some of this analysis in future iterations of
        THE GRID.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Interview Cleaning & Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The fall program leaves a legacy of more than 20,000 minutes (350+
        hours) of recorded interview time and associated transcript trend
        scanning. Audio recordings were automatically transcribed via Amazon
        Transcribe. However, we did not approve Amazon’s usage of the data
        beyond the transcription process or on servers outside of Canada. The
        transcripts were reviewed for accuracy, removal of personal identifiers,
        and expletives. The transcripts were meant to stay as close to the
        spoken language as possible, honouring youth ways of speaking and local
        expressions. They therefore include words such as ‘um’ and ‘like’.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being checked for accuracy, the interviews were reviewed to
        identify themes. To ensure consistency across the many people conducting
        the thematic analysis, a list of topics and themes
        <a
          href="https://youthfulcities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-2020_Sentis-Interview-Theme-Dictionary_Final.xlsx"
          >(the thematic dictionary)</a
        >
        was created prior to analysis. The dictionary is based on the questions
        asked in the interviews and on a pre-set list of urban topics.
        Interviewee comments could be assigned to multiple themes; not all
        comments were assigned to a theme. Basic demographic information about
        the interviewee is included with their verbatim comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once coding was completed, all copies of the recordings were destroyed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Interview on THE GRID</h3>
      <p>
        The publication of these topics and quotes display a wide array of youth
        experiences and unique stories in each youth’s own words. The project
        hopes to inspire readers through these engaging stories.
