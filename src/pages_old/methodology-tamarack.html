        This data was collected by Youthful Cities in collaboration with The
        Tamarack Institute, organizations participating in the Communities
        Building Youth Futures Initiative, and with youth in the communities
        they serve. The community partners went through the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Define topics</li>
        <li>Select indicators</li>
        <li>Select measurements</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Where possible, existing indicators and measurements from the Pivot 2020
        project were used
        <a href="/pages/learnmore/#processes"
          >(see the Pivot 2020 methodology)</a
        >. Where a need was identified, new indicators and measurements were
        proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To review indicators and measurements the Indicator Design Committee
        (IDC) was assembled. This committee was composed of youth and youth
        organization representatives from the communities / cities involved in
        the data collection project. The purpose of the committee members is to
        engage and put forward youth perspectives on what matters most to them
        in their communities.
      </p>
      <p>IDC members were asked the following question for each topic:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In your words, how would you define (add topic here)?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For example: In your words, how would you define Employment and
          Mentorship?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        IDC members then completed the following questions for each measurement:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On a scale of 1 to 5, please rate the (add indicator name) Indicator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For example: On a scale of 1 to 5, please rate the "Youth Employment
          Centres" Indicator.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How relevant is this indicator to measure Employment and Mentorship?
          </li>
          <li>
            How inclusive is this indicator of the community your organization
            is serving/you are living in?
          </li>
          <li>How intuitive is the language/wording of this indicator?</li>
          <li>
            If you were to try to get data on this indicator in your city today,
            how easy would it be to access?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Each Indicator is also followed up with the following short answer
        question:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reflecting on your evaluation, this indicator would be even better if:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, the IDC were asked the following questions in review:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Now that you have reviewed all the indicators for (topic), according
          to your lived experience and reality, this list of indicators would be
          even better if we:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>(List Indicator here):</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Keep it</li>
            <li>Keep with modifications</li>
            <li>Remove it</li>
          </ol>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Aside from the above, could you think of any new indicators that would
          assist in measuring/collecting data for the (add topic) topic in your
          community?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When assessing the results, the final question in each topic was used as
        the base for assessment. Indicators that received support two thirds
        (66.6%) IDC (members who voted for “Keep it”) were passed without
        modifications, while the remaining were further reviewed by the IDC.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the IDC members were able to discuss and propose modifications to
        indicators, the indicators were reworded or removed as needed. The
        measurements may just need to be reworded to meet community
        understanding and language, or certain ones may need to be modified to
        align with youth needs and collectibility. Example: “Student to career
        counsellor ratio in high school” would be easier to collect by simply
        asking "Is there a dedicated career counsellor available in high
        school"? The change would remove the assumption that career counselling
        already exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Final feedback was collected from IDC members after changes had been
        made for any further thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        After indicators and measurements had been finalized, data was
        collected. Data collectors had strong lived experience in the cities
        they collected in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following data collection, the data was validated to ensure accuracy and
        completion. This includes validating sources, making sure values are in
        the right format, and ensuring values are comparable. Example: If the
        data is asking collectors to enter "annual cost of a transit pass",
        ensure the value entered is not cost per month. If it is, multiply it by
        12 and update the value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the data was validated, it was cleaned by our data analysts and
        uploaded to the Grid for all to use and learn from.
