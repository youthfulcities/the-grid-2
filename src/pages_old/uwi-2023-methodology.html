        <h2>Indicators & <span class="alt-highlight">Measurements</span></h2>
        <div class="inner-container">
            <h3>Selection of Indicators and Measurements</h3>
            <p>To break down each topic, indicators are used. Indicators start with a question we want to answer. For example, how good is the public library system in the city? From this we might create an indicator called &ldquo;Public libraries&rdquo;. Indicators are then used to create measurements, which are quantifiable data points that help us to evaluate the indicator, for example, number of libraries.</p>
            <p>For the 2023 index, we started with the same indicator structure as the Urban Work Index 2019 and reviewed the measurements. To determine if a measurement would be included in the 2023 index, the following questions were asked:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is it still relevant in 2023? (e.g., is it COVID related?)</li>
                <li>Will it influence a decision for a young person to work in a city?</li>
                <li>Is quality data available for this measurement?</li>
                <li>Is the data stratified across cities? (i.e., not all the same)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the answer to any of these questions was no, then the measurement was removed. If possible, it was replaced with a more relevant measurement or reworded to ensure it was of relevance and quality. New measurements were also created or indicators were expanded to align with the changing needs of youth in 2023 as compared to 2019 and 2021. For the most part, new measurements were designed around central collection sources, such as Statistics Canada, to ensure the most accurate, comparable data.</p>
            <p>As data collection and cleaning proceeded, if it became apparent that quality data could not be found for the majority of cities on a particulate measurement, it was removed.</p>
            <p>Since some measurements were removed and others were added during the collection process, measurements needed to be regrouped during the scoring process into indicators that made sense and did not overweight certain measurements. (An indicator with only 1 measurement in it gives that measurement more weight than an indicator that has 5 measurements in it.) Since &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; type measurements are weaker data points with less stratification between cities, multiple &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; measurements are always combined to form an indicator. Indicators were renamed to reflect the measurements as accurately as possible.</p>
            <h3 class="top-margin-large">Scoring</h3>
            <p>All scoring was performed using min-max normalization. Measurements were scaled so that the lowest performing city received 0 points and the best performing city received 100 points. If an indicator was made up of multiple measurements, the normalized scores were averaged. Min-max normalization was then performed again on the averaged scores so that each indicator was scaled between 0 and 100. All indicators in a topic were then averaged to produce a topic score out of 100. Topic scores were then weighted and added together to produce the final score (see the section &ldquo;Weighting Survey&rdquo;).</p>
            <p>For standard measurements, scoring assumed a higher absolute value was better. When multiple cities make up a city group, the values of all the cities were averaged before scoring (e.g., walk score).</p>
            <p>For &ldquo;number of&rdquo; measurements, the values for all the cities in a city group were added together before scoring. Most &ldquo;number of&rdquo; measurements were scored based on per capita calculations. A small number of &ldquo;number of&rdquo; measurements were scored based on both absolute and per capita calculations. The step ensures cities of different population and geographic sizes can be compared in a fair method. This helps to factor in not just availability of certain resources but also variety. For an explanation of the populations used in per capita calculations, please see the &ldquo;Defining Cities&rdquo; section.</p>
            <p>For &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; measurements, if the main city was a &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it was assumed to be a yes for the whole city group. If the main city was a no, we relooked at the secondary cities. If any of the secondary cities within the geography were a yes, then the whole city group was assumed to be a yes. This helped to mitigate negative scores caused by lack of data in smaller cities and ensured that scores for the 30 city groups were always either 100 or 0 for &ldquo;yes/no&rdquo; measurements.</p>
            <p>Many measurements were only applicable to the main city within a city group or had limited data available in secondary cities. In this case, secondary cities were not included in calculations.</p>
            <p>For a small number of measurements, data for Yellowknife or Whitehorse was not available. In that case, those measurements were not included in their scores.</p>
            <p>For the rationale behind city groups, please refer to the &ldquo;Defining Cities&rdquo; section.</p>
            <p>For additional scoring information, please see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F1vu3m7yUF4wge0M2x9X3t8zFeIeHKkgvrTMmERtxKo/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1685979854055107&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Q608EHr_4a5QNq4aVCUO6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UWI 2023 Measurement Codebook</a></p>

A CA must have a core population of at least 10,000 also based on data from the previous Census of Population Program.</em></p>

            <p><em>A census metropolitan area (CMA) or a census agglomeration (CA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a population centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 based on data from the current Census of Population Program, of which 50,000 or more must live in the core based on adjusted data from the previous Census of Population Program.</em></p>
            <p><em>To be included in the CMA or CA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from data on place of work from the previous Census Program.</em></p>
            <p class="top-margin"><strong>Census division (CD):</strong></p>
            <p><em>Group of neighboring municipalities joined together for the purposes of regional planning and managing common services (such as police or ambulance services). These groupings are established under laws in effect in certain provinces of Canada. Census division (CD) is the general term for provincially legislated areas (such as county, municipalit&eacute; r&eacute;gionale de comt&eacute; (MRC) and regional district) or their equivalents. In other provinces and the territories where laws do not provide for such areas, Statistics Canada defines equivalent areas for statistical reporting purposes in cooperation with these provinces and territories. Census divisions are intermediate geographic areas between the province/territory level and the municipality (census subdivision).</em></p>
            <p class="top-margin"><strong>Census subdivision (CSD):</strong></p>
            <p><em>Census subdivision (CSD) is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial/territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indian reserves, Indian settlements and unorganized territories). Municipal status is defined by laws in effect in each province and territory in Canada.</em></p>
            <p class="top-margin">City groups for the Urban Work Index are mainly based around CMAs. CMA data is usually the lowest level of disaggregated regional data available on Statistics Canada. However, when collecting data from other sources, usually only municipal (CSD) data is available. So, we needed to define which cities are included in our CMA groups when collecting data from sources other than Statistics Canada or when Statistics Canada provides CSD-level data.</p>
            <p>To define which cities would be a part of our city groups, we selected all the population centres within the CMA that have a population over 50,000.</p>

            <p class="top-margin-large">The exceptions to this rule are Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Laval, and Montreal. Mississauga and Brampton both fall under the Toronto CMA, and Laval falls under the Montreal CMA. However, in this index, each of those CSDs was ranked individually. We looked at these cities on a CSD level and not a CMA level because of their large populations and uniqueness from other cities in their CMAs. In the case of measurements where only CMA-level data was available, each CSD within the CMA would receive the same value and score. This is similar to how all cities in a province will receive the same value and score when data is only available at the provincial level.</p>
            <p>For the city groups, depending on the measurement, the data for each CSD was either added together (for example, # of walking trails) or averaged (for example, walk score) to get the overall score (see the &ldquo;Scoring&rdquo; section).</p>
            <p>To make per capita calculations, we used the 2021 CSD totals on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang%3DE&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1685979854128656&amp;usg=AOvVaw0W1hh71Sa8dGW4QNotp2Mn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistics Canada</a> . For the city groups, we added up the individual CSD totals of all the cities included in the groups (as depicted in green in Fig. 1). For a small number of measurements that were both CMA based and per capita based, we used the CMA populations in our calculations instead. Populations can be found in the &ldquo;Populations&rdquo; tab of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F1vu3m7yUF4wge0M2x9X3t8zFeIeHKkgvrTMmERtxKo/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1685979854129241&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FRvrRfIi7bE7OpIcBXIZ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UWI 2023 Codebook</a> , and notes on which measurements are CMA-based can be found in the &ldquo;MAIN&rdquo; tab.</p>
            <p>Some measurements were specifically scored per capita against the youth (15-29) population. To get the youth population, we used the same method as the total population and added up the age groups 15 to 19 years, 20 to 24 years, and 25 to 29 years.</p>

        <div class="inner-container">
            <p>Each topic in the Urban Work Index 2023 was given a weighting out of 1 based on how important the topics are to youth. The weight was used as a multiplication factor to calculate the final scores.</p>
            <p>E.g., Toronto received 96.33 points in Digital Access. Digital Access has a weight of 0.80.</p>
            <p>96.33*0,80 = 77.06</p>
            <p>Therefore, Toronto gets 77.06 points from Digital Access added to its final score.</p>
            <p>We conducted a survey in March 2023 to determine how youth felt about each topic in the index. After conducting the survey and removing responses from outside of Canada, responses from participants outside the age range of 15-29, and responses suspected to be spam, the total sample size was 201.</p>
            <p>To calculate the final rankings, the scores respondents gave for each topic on a scale of 1 to 10 were averaged and divided by 100 to get a final weight out of 1.</p>
